As the client, I would like to focus on Revenue-Generated across all stores and cities. For this purpose, I require a switchable Top N feature that allows me to view which products are performing well and compare the selected product's revenue to the overall revenue. Additionally, I would like to see a revenue trend on a monthly basis, which can help me identify the sales patterns and adjust my business strategies accordingly.
Another requirement is a revenue comparison across sales regions, allowing me to identify which regions are contributing more revenue than others. This feature will help me better allocate my resources to maximize profits. To further streamline the dashboard, I would like to have a single slicer that allows me to select both the month and year, which will allow me to filter the dashboard data based on my requirements.
Finally, I need a slicer for regions, allowing me to further filter and analyze the data based on specific regions of interest. I look forward to hearing from you and seeing a dashboard that meets these requirements.
